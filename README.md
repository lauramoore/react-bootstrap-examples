# react-bootstrap-example

I had not found any discussion on how to best design for responsive components
using react and bootstrap.

React Component need to have a single root node,  would it be best then to 
design all components to be wrapped as <Row><Col xs={12}> ... </Row><Col>  or just
a simple <div> and then <Row><Col>...</Row</Col> internal to that?

These are the things that keep me up at night...
